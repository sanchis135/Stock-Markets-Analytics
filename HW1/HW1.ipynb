    "\n",
    "Data source & retrieval: Use APIs such as NewsAPI, Twitter API (v2), or web scraping tools to collect text data, then apply NLP sentiment models like VADER or fine-tuned transformers (e.g., FinBERT).\n",

    "\n",
    "Broader economic conditions influence investor behavior and stock price reactions. Including these factors could help differentiate earnings reactions during different market regimes.\n",
    "\n",
